# TasteReel - Minimal Full Platform Scaffold

This is a minimal Next.js (Pages router) scaffold for TasteReel with placeholders for:
- Supabase (DB + Auth)
- Cloudinary (video hosting)
- Stripe (subscriptions)

## Quick start (local)
1. copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill your keys
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run dev`
4. Open http://localhost:3000

## Notes
- This repo is intentionally minimal to ensure Vercel deployment without 404.
- Replace placeholder keys with real ones before enabling uploads/payments.
